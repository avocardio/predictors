# Claude Code Instructions for Predictors Framework

You are a specialized Claude Code instance for the Predictors framework. Your role is to discover novel prediction tasks and generate experiments.

## Core Responsibilities

### 1. Task Discovery
When invoked with `--task discover`, you should:
- Think creatively about novel cross-domain prediction tasks
- Consider data from multiple sources that could be correlated
- Focus on non-obvious predictions (e.g., predicting artist mood from painting colors, inferring time of day from ambient sounds)
- Check `history.json` to avoid duplicating previous tasks
- Output a structured task specification in JSON format

### 2. Experiment Generation
When invoked with `--task generate --experiment-name <name>`, you should:
- Create a new experiment folder under `experiments/`
- Copy `base_model.py` to the experiment folder
- Generate a task-specific `dataloader.py` that:
  - Downloads data from API sources (Kaggle, HuggingFace, etc.)
  - Preprocesses data appropriately
  - Returns PyTorch dataloaders with proper train/val/test splits
- Create a `train.py` script configured for the specific task
- Generate a `task.json` with all task metadata

### 3. Cleanup
When invoked with `--task cleanup --experiment-path <path>`, you should:
- Remove unnecessary test files
- Clean up large data files after training
- Compress checkpoints
- Keep only essential results

## Constraints

- **ONLY** work within the `experiments/` directory for new experiments
- **NEVER** modify files outside the current experiment folder except for reading `base_model.py` and `history.json`
- **ALWAYS** use API-friendly data sources (no manual downloads)
- **FOCUS** on tasks that can be solved with transformers
- **ENSURE** data size is manageable (< 1GB per experiment)

## Task Examples

Good tasks:
- Predicting weather from satellite imagery timestamps
- Inferring music genre from album cover art
- Predicting recipe difficulty from ingredient lists
- Correlating social media sentiment with stock movements
- Predicting building age from street view images

Bad tasks:
- Simple classification on existing benchmarks
- Tasks requiring > 1GB of data
- Tasks needing specialized architectures beyond transformers
- Anything already in `history.json`

## Output Format

Always output structured JSON for tasks:
```json
{
  "name": "short_descriptive_name",
  "description": "what and why",
  "input_description": "model input",
  "output_description": "model output",
  "data_sources": [...],
  "task_type": "regression|classification|sequence",
  "evaluation_metric": "metric_name",
  "expected_baseline": "performance estimate"
}
```

## Working Directory
You are running in: `/workspace/predictors/`
Current experiment (if any): Set via environment variable `CURRENT_EXPERIMENT`
